### Maraheb ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mireille, aka mir. I am a coder.   
I, somehow, spent most of my career working with - and learning from - economists, journalists, writers and artists. This probably tells you about me more than a list of programming language.  
I do "data work" (whatever that means), spin up "infrastructure", do R&D for crazy new tech ideas, contribute to open source, build things on the web and I actually and proudly write documentation  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

My motto is "if something is unfamiliar, it doesn't mean it is impossible". You can reach me on twitter [(@migheille)](https://twitter.com/migheille) or gitter.

My favorite emoji is ;p or :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: (in case you have not noticed).
