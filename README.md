I'm Mireille, aka mir. I am a coder. I somehow spent most of my time and career working with (and learning from) economists, journalists/writers and artists...That probably tells you more about me than a list of programming languages that I know.  

I usually do "data work" (whatever that means), spin up "tech infrastructure", do R&D for crazy new tech ideas, build things on the web and I actually and proudly write documentation ;p.

My motto is "if something is unfamiliar, it doesn't mean it is impossible". 

You can reach me on twitter (@migheille), on gitter(mireille-raad) or check out my always outdated blog on [mireilleraad.com](https://mireilleraad.com) ;p

My favorite emoji is ;p or :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: (in case you have not noticed).
